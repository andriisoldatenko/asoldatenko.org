### Beyond Limts k8s

#### Intro
based Gardener OSS
Horizontally scalable k8s controllers

https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/kccnceu2025/c6/Beyond%20The%20Limits.pdf

Problem:
Controllers must prevent conflicts
• Perform leader election
• Only a single active instance
• Controllers are not horizontally scalable
• Limits large-scale use cases
• No standard solution exists

Design – Key Feature
• Sharding mechanisms inspired by distributed databases
• Dynamic membership and failure detection
• Automatic failover and rebalancing
• Transparent label-based coordination
• Prevents concurrent reconciliations
• Reusable implementation
