### Tuomas (the author) of "Wishmaster" by Nightwish? song

> This is my personal tribute to fantasy, especially the closest to me; Tolkien & Dragonlance. These worlds have become a sort of inverted reality for me, where the story of "The Kinslayer"* can't become reality... Moreover, I don't believe in this thing called "destiny". We are the masters of our own wishes, beliefs and dreams. Whatever you desire enough, it can happen. Destiny is an excuse for those who don't have the strength to fulfil their wishes. Everything is possible. Even the impossible.


> The only thing standing between you and outrageous success is continuous progress.

> -- <cite>Dan Waldschmidt</cite>


> The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.
> -- <cite>[Albert Einstein][1]</cite>
